### Teaching Award

I am the winner of the **Gitner Prize for Excellence in Teaching Undergraduates** at Boston University in 2023. The award is for the "Graduate Student who excels as the most exemplary teacher of undergraduates within the Department of Economics.‚Äù  It is meant to recognize long-term excellence in a variety of teaching services including TF, instructor in CAS courses (summer and regular academic year), and MET instructor.

### Teaching Experience

**Instructor for Labor Economics**, Boston University, Spring 2022, Spring 2023

I designed the course myself and with help from #EconTwitter. A sample syllabus is available [here](pdfs/EC356_Syllabus.pdf). 87% of the students rated my teaching as "Excellent", "Very Good" or "Good" (N=54). Some selected qualitative comments below:


> "Professor Li's passion for labor economics is truly on display every day in class. Her expertise in the field is abundantly clear."

> "Professor Li is an awesome instructor...She is knowledgeable about the content she is teaching and willing to offer help. LOVE her class so much."

> "(She) Will explain concepts and answer any questions. Prompt with returning emails. Had fun assignments to complete. Gave me the ability to read and understand econ papers outside of class."
