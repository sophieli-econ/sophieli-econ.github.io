### Job Market Paper

The Effect of a Woman-Friendly Occupation on Employment: U.S. Postmasters Before WWII [[Draft]](pdfs/SophieLi_JMP.pdf)

* _Rosenstein-Rodan Prize for Best Graduate Student Paper, Boston University, 2023_

  <summary>Summary</summary>
  
This paper examines the effect of a woman-friendly occupation by exploring a unique historical setting -- the postmaster occupation during the early 20th-century United States, which had many woman-friendly features unprecedented in its time. With regression discontinuity and diff-in-diff designs, I find that although a woman-friendly occuption attracted many qualified women into the labor force, it offered few long-term benefits to women's future employment.
