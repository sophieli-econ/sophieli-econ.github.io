I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at Boston University. My research fields are Economic History, Labor Economics and Economics of Gender.

I am on the job market during the 2023-2024 Academic Year. My job market paper examines the effect of a woman-friendly occupation, the postmaster occupation during the early twentieth-century United States, on women's employment outcomes.

I am PhD candidate in Economics at Harvard University. I will be on the job market during the 2023-2024 academic year. You can reach me at <garg@g.harvard.edu>.
