I designed the course myself and with help from #EconTwitter. A sample syllabus is available [here](pdfs/EC356_Syllabus.pdf). 87% of the students rated my teaching as "Excellent", "Very Good" or "Good" (N=54). Some selected qualitative comments below:

> "Professor Li's passion for labor economics is truly on display every day in class. Her expertise in the field is abundantly clear."

> "Professor Li is an awesome instructor...She is knowledgeable about the content she is teaching and willing to offer help. LOVE her class so much."
