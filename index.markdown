I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at Boston University. My research fields are Economic History, Labor Economics and Economics of Gender. You can reach me at <ywl242@bu.edu>.

I am on the job market during the 2023-2024 Academic Year. My job market paper examines the effect of a woman-friendly occupation, the postmaster occupation during the early 20th-century United States, on women's employment outcomes. The draft of my job market paper is [here](pdfs/SophieLi_JMP.pdf).
